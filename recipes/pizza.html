                <li>Add 113 grams luke warm water to a medium sixed bowl.</li>
                <li>Add your 1 tsp sugar, dissolve it, then add your yeast and wait until blooms to make sure its still active.</li>
                <li>Once you see the yeast bloom, add your olive oil, salt and flour to the bowl. Mix by hand until the four has absorbed all the moisture.</li>
                <li>Mix by hand for an additional 5 minutes to strengthen the gluten by folding the pizza dough into itself. If your hand gets too sticky you can add a little more flour.</li>
                <li>Let rest and cover with plastic wrap overnight in the fridge or for at least 4 hours at room temperature or until doubled in size.</li>
                <li>When preparing the dough for cooking, form into a ball and let rest for at least 30 minutes.</li>

                <li>Mix all the ingredients for the sauce mixture together and let rest for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            </ol>

                <li>Grab a medium sized pan and add your vegetable oil, corn meal, garlic powder, salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>At this point, stretch out your dough ball into a disk shape as best as you can. Be gentle and patient.</li>
                <li>When your dough is reasonably stretched to the point it can take up the space in your pan, heat the pan on medium high heat.</li>
                <li>When warmed, slide your dough onto the pan.</li>
                <li>Immediately add your sauce and desired parmesan on top of the dough and let cook for about 3-4 minutes. </li>
