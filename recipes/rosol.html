    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>As a Polish American, this dish is one that has always been close to my heart, and a huge part of my childhood. This is a traditional polish chicken and vegetable noodle broth soup that is great to eat all year round.</p>
    <p>The soup itself is a simple one, however there are a few variations using one or more kinds of meat. In this recipe, we will use the standard one using chicken tighs.</p>

    <h2>The Rosol Ingredients</h2>

    <li>5 liters water</li>
    <li>70 grams of dry angel hair egg noodles.</li>
    <li>1/2 a white or yellow onion</li>
    <li>2 carrots</li>
    <li>3-4 stalks of fresh celery</li>
    <li>2-3 leaves of leek</li>
    <li>3 tbsp vegeta seasoning</li>
    <li>2 chicken tighs (with the skin)</li>
    <li>2 dried bolette mushrooms</li>
    <li>4 branches of fresh parsley</li>
    <li>4 branches of fresh dill</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring 5 liters of water in a large pot up to a light boil, then add your chicken.</li>
        <li>As the chicken is being boiled, spoon off the foam that forms during the boiling. Lightly boil for about 5-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>When the chicken no longer forms foam on the surface of the water, add your celery, parsley, shaved carrots and leeks. (make sure to rinse your vegetables before submerging them into the broth.</li>
        <li>Add 2-3 large spoonfulls of vegeta seasoning and taste the broth to measure salt levels accordingly.</li>
        <li>Add a few twists of ground pepper or about 6 pepper corns.</li>
        <li>Char your half onion on an open flame or on a pan until completely black on the outside, then place into your broth.</li>
        <li>Keep your broth on a constant light simmer on medium low heat for the next hour with a lid half way on to keep the heat in.</li>
        <li>While the broth is cooking, prepare your noodles by boiling water in a medium sized pot and add 2 tsp sea salt.</li>
        <li>When the water is vigorously boiling, add your dry noodles to the water.</li>
        <li>Boil your noodles for about 5-10 minutes or until soft. Make sure your noodles are not too hard.</li>
        <li>Once your noodles are done, strain them and rinse with warm water and let rest until the soup is ready.</li>
        <li>5 minutes before serving, throw in your dill and keep on a very low heat.</li>
