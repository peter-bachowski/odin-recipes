# odin-recipes
This exercise will be my first html project that involves the use of git. 
The purpose of this exercise is to practice the use of the most basic html tools as well as basic git workflow.
The recipes in this project are all originals and were not copied from any source.
I hope my recipes will be of some use to someone some day.
My specialty is the pizza recipe, and the rosol recipe is a family recipe.
I hope you enjoy and thank you.
